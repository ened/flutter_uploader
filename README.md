# Flutter Uploader

A plugin for creating and managing upload tasks. Supports iOS and Android.

This plugin is based on [`WorkManager`][1] in Android and [`NSURLSessionUploadTask`][2] in iOS to run upload task in background mode.

This plugin is inspired by [`flutter_downloader`][5]. Thanks to Hung Duy Ha & Flutter Community for great plugins and inspiration.

## iOS integration

### Note: This is written in swift when you create the flutter project use -i swift option

- Enable background mode.

### Optional configuration:

- **Configure maximum number of connection per host ** the plugin allows 3 simultaneous http connection per host running at a moment by default. You can change this number by adding following codes to your `Info.plist` file.

```xml
<!-- changes this number to configure the maximum number of concurrent tasks -->
<key>FUMaximumConnectionsPerHost</key>
<integer>3</integer>
```

- **Configure maximum number of concurrent upload operation:** the plugin allows 3 simultaneous upload operation running at a moment by default. You can change this number by adding following codes to your `Info.plist` file.

```xml
<!-- changes this number to configure the maximum number of concurrent tasks -->
<key>FUMaximumUploadOperation</key>
<integer>3</integer>
```

- **Configure request timeout:** controls how long (in seconds) a task should wait for additional data to arrive before giving up `Info.plist` file.

```xml
<!-- changes this number to configure the request timeout -->
<key>FUTimeoutInSeconds</key>
<integer>3600</integer>
```

- **Localize notification messages:** the plugin will send a notification message to notify user when all files are uploaded while your application is not running in foreground. This message is English by default. You can localize this message by adding and localizing following message in `Info.plist` file. (you can find the detail of `Info.plist` localization in this [link][3])

```xml
<key>FUAllFilesUploadedMessage</key>
<string>All files have been uploaded</string>
```

## Android integration

### Optional configuration:

- **Configure maximum number of concurrent tasks:** the plugin depends on `WorkManager` library and `WorkManager` depends on the number of available processor to configure the maximum number of tasks running at a moment. You can setup a fixed number for this configuration by adding following codes to your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
 <provider
     android:name="androidx.work.impl.WorkManagerInitializer"
     android:authorities="${applicationId}.workmanager-init"
     android:enabled="false"
     android:exported="false" />

 <provider
     android:name="com.bluechilli.flutteruploader.FlutterUploaderInitializer"
     android:authorities="${applicationId}.flutter-upload-init"
     android:exported="false">
     <!-- changes this number to configure the maximum number of concurrent tasks -->
     <meta-data
         android:name="com.bluechilli.flutterupload.MAX_CONCURRENT_TASKS"
         android:value="3" />

     <!-- changes this number to configure connection timeout for the upload http request -->
     <meta-data android:name="com.bluechilli.flutteruploader.UPLOAD_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT_IN_SECONDS" android:value="3600" />
 </provider>
```

- **Localize notification messages:** you can localize notification messages of upload progress by localizing following messages. (you can find the detail of string localization in Android in this [link][4])

```xml
<string name="flutter_uploader_notification_started">Upload started</string>
<string name="flutter_uploader_notification_in_progress">Upload in progress</string>
<string name="flutter_uploader_notification_canceled">Upload canceled</string>
<string name="flutter_uploader_notification_failed">Upload failed</string>
<string name="flutter_uploader_notification_complete">Upload complete</string>
```

- **Firebase integration:** there's a conflict problem between `WorkManager` and `Firebase` library (related to `Guava` library). The problem is expected to be resolved in new version of `Guava` and `Gradle` build tools. For now, you can work around it by adding some codes to your `build.gradle` (in `android` folder).

```gradle
allprojects {
    ...

    configurations.all {
        exclude group: 'com.google.guava', module: 'failureaccess'

        resolutionStrategy {
            eachDependency { details ->
                if('guava' == details.requested.name) {
                    details.useVersion '27.0-android'
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

```

## Usage

#### Import package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_uploader/flutter_uploader.dart';
```

#### Initialize uploader:

- This is a singleton object

```dart
final uploader = FlutterUploader();
```

#### Create new upload task:

```dart
final taskId = await uploader.enqueue(
  url: "your upload link", //required: url to upload to
  files: [FileItem(filename: filename, savedDir: savedDir, fieldname:"file")], // required: list of files that you want to upload
  method: UploadMethod.POST, // HTTP method  (POST or PUT or PATCH)
  headers: {"apikey": "api_123456", "userkey": "userkey_123456"},
  data: {"name": "john"}, // any data you want to send in upload request
  showNotification: false, // send local notification (android only) for upload status
  tag: "upload 1"); // unique tag for upload task
);
```

### listen for upload progress

```dart
  final subscription = uploader.progress.listen((progress) {
      //... code to handle progress
  });
```

### listen for upload result

```dart
  final subscription = uploader.result.listen((result) {
      //... code to handle result
  }, onError: (ex, stacktrace) {
      // ... code to handle error
  });
```

note: when tasks are cancelled, it will send on onError handler as exception with status = cancelled

#### Cancel an upload task:

```dart
uploader.cancel(taskId: taskId);
```

#### Cancel all upload tasks:

```dart
uploader.cancelAll();
